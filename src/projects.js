      This game was made in 36 hours days for Hack the North 2021, and was my first attempt at multiplayer. My teammate and I had never done anything with networking before, so we had a hard time understanding many of the basic concepts. Because of the short time limit for this hackathon, this game is full of bugs (But at least you can experience it with friends).

      This game was made in 5 days for the Brackeys 2020.2 Jam. With this project, I tried to focus more on the design aspect. I spent more time on trying to make the game feel more satisfying, and on making more creative puzzles. Blast to the Past placed in the top 10% overall out of around 1.8k entries.

      This was the first finished game I worked on. It was made in 72 hours for the ScoreSpace #9 Jam. Out of around 120 entries, Skelascent placed 4th overall and 1st place in aesthetics! This project taught me a lot about the general workflow, and how important time management, communication, and teamwork was.

      I am currently developing a port of this game to mobile devices.
