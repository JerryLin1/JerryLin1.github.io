      This was the first finished game I worked on. It was made in 72 hours for the ScoreSpace #9 Jam. Out of around 120 entries, Skelascent placed 4th overall and 1st place in aesthetics! This project taught me a lot about the general workflow, and how important time management, communication, and teamwork was.

      This game was made in 7 days (although we had to start on the 3rd day, so really it was 5 days) for the Brackeys 2020.2 Jam. Because we had so much more time compared to Skelascent, we decided to focus more on the design aspect. We spent more time on trying to make the game feel more satisfying, and on making more creative puzzles.

      This game was made in 36 hours days for Hack the North 2021, and was my first attempt at multiplayer. My teammate and I had never done anything with networking before, so even basic concepts like servers and ports gave us a hard time. Because of our short time limit, this game is full of bugs (But at least you can experience it with friends).
