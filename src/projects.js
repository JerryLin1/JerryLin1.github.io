      This game was made in 36 hours days for Hack the North 2021, and was my first attempt at multiplayer. My teammate and I had never done anything with networking before, so even basic concepts like servers and ports gave us a hard time. Because of our short time limit, this game is full of bugs (But at least you can experience it with friends).

      This game was made in 5 days for the Brackeys 2020.2 Jam. With this project, I tried to focus more on the design aspect. I spent more time on trying to make the game feel more satisfying, and on making more creative puzzles. Blast to the Past placed in the top 10% overall out of around 1.8k entries.

      This was the first finished game I worked on. It was made in 72 hours for the ScoreSpace #9 Jam. Out of around 120 entries, Skelascent placed 4th overall and 1st place in aesthetics! This project taught me a lot about the general workflow, and how important time management, communication, and teamwork was.
